# spam-detection
Developed a model with Naive Bayes classifier to classify emails as spam or not spam.

In this project, a Naive Bayes classifier was applied to a given dataset to classify emails into two categories: spam or not spam. The model's performance was evaluated using key metrics.

- **Accuracy**: The model exhibited high accuracy, correctly classifying emails in approximately 98.4% of cases.
- **Precision**: The precision score of 98.5% indicated that the majority of emails classified as spam were indeed spam, minimizing false positive instances.
- **Recall**: With a recall score of 89.3%, the model successfully identified most of the actual spam emails, indicating a strong ability to detect spam.
- **F1-Score**: The F1-score of 93.7% represented a balance between precision and recall, suggesting a robust overall performance of the model.

In summary, the Naive Bayes classifier demonstrated excellent effectiveness in distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails, showcasing high accuracy and balanced precision-recall trade-off. This work highlights the model's reliability in email classification tasks, making it a valuable tool in filtering out unwanted spam emails.
